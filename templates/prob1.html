<pre>	
Alia loves Raj. But she keeps wondering whether Raj loves her. Of course, the best way to know it is fortune telling. 
There are many ways of telling fortune, but Alia has picked the easiest one. She takes in her hand one or several camomiles and tears off the petals one by one. 
After each petal she pronounces alternatively "Loves" and "Doesn't love", at that Alia always starts with "Loves".
There are n camomiles growing in the field, possessing the numbers of petals equal to a1, a2, ... an. Alia wants to pick a bouquet with the maximal possible 
total number of petals so that the result would still be "Loves". 
Help her do that; find the maximal number of petals possible in the bouquet.



Input
The first line denotes the t i.e. number of test cases.
The second line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), which is the number of flowers growing in the field. The third line contains n integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) 
which represent the number of petals on a given i-th camomile.



Output
Print a single number which is the maximal number of petals in the bouquet, the fortune telling on which would result in "Loves". If there are no such bouquet, 
print 0 instead. The bouquet may consist of a single flower.
